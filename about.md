We are made of the iron forged in the hearts of stars. No wonder we feel a deep connection to the dim little lights scattered across the night sky. At some point in life, almost everyone has dreamt of becoming an astronaut or an astrophysicist. Yet, only a few of us ever make it there.

Some are pulled toward other passions. Some are driven away by unfortunate events. Some lose heart when faced with poorly taught physics. Others lose passion as they struggle with endless equations or the suffocating bureaucracy of academia. Whatever the reason, many of us drift away from the dream, but the dream never truly drifts away from us. It stays, quietly glowing in the background.

My story is no different. I didn’t lose my love for physics; I simply let myself get distracted when I had the chance to pursue it. Because of that, I’ve been left behind—or maybe I left it behind. Still, the visions remain. The music of the cosmos still keeps me awake at night. And I don’t want others to lose that music.

Physics and astrophysics are among the hardest subjects to teach and to learn, especially when professors are better researchers than teachers. Proper resources are scarce, and paywalls block so much of what should be free knowledge. That’s why I built this website: to share what I know, as clearly and openly as I can.

I hope these words find you when you feel lost in a tangle of equations that seem both incomprehensible and beautiful. And I hope, in those moments, I can help you see the beauty that first made you look up at the stars.
