I’m **Suyash Sakhare** — BS in Astronomy, BA in Filmmaking.  

It is always a little tough to write about yourself without sounding like you’re trying too hard. You won’t find a dramatic life story here, just a few things that make me, me:  

1. I enjoy learning new things. Give me YouTube and a few books and I can teach myself almost anything.  
2. I thrive on organization and planning. I can think quickly on my feet, and I am always trying to improve my workflow — a skill that proves just as useful on film sets as it does in the corporate world.  
3. I do not believe in half measures. If I am going to do something, I’ll do it properly. If not, I’d rather not do it at all.  
4. I enjoy working with people. The best ideas and inventions, I believe, happen when people work together for people.
